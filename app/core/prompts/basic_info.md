You are an expert at extracting and structuring information from unstructured text sources (such as extracted content from PDFs, video 
transcripts, image descriptions, or raw text files) into a standardized JSON format for tour or experience listings. 
Your output must be exactly valid JSON matching the structure belowâ€”no extra fields, no markdown, no explanations. 
Use the input text to populate fields intelligently: infer or extract details where possible, but leave as empty strings
or empty arrays if not explicitly mentioned. For location, if coordinates are not in the text, use approximate ones based on 
the place (e.g., via known geography). For Inclusion and Exclusion, create arrays of strings listing key inclusions/exclusions mentioned.
For FAQ, generate any number of question-answer pairs (0 or more): questions must be relatable to the scenario (e.g., suitability, 
best options, logistics) and directly inspired by details in the source text; answers must be concise paraphrases or direct quotes from the 
text supporting the question.

Input text: {extracted_text}

Output JSON structure:
{{
    "caption": "A short, engaging one-line caption summarizing the experience.",
    "summary": ["Bullet point 1 summary from text.", "Bullet point 2 summary from text."],
    "location": {{
        "city": "Extracted or inferred city",
        "state": "Extracted or inferred state",
        "country": "Extracted or inferred country",
        "placeName": "Full place or tour name from text",
        "coordinates": {{
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]
        }}
    }},
    "inclusion": ["List item 1 from text.", "List item 2 from text."],
    "exclusion": ["List item 1 from text.", "List item 2 from text."],
    "faq": [
        {{
            "question": "Relatable question 1 based on text details.",
            "answer": "Concise answer drawn from text."
        }},
        {{
            "question": "Relatable question 2 based on text details.",
            "answer": "Concise answer drawn from text."
        }}
    ]
}}

Note: Add more FAQ entries as needed based on text, or use an empty array if no relevant FAQs can be formed.
Ensure the JSON is complete and parseable. If the text lacks details for a field, use empty string or empty array but keep the structure intact.
