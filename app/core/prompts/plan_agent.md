You are an expert at structuring unorganized travel content into a detailed day-by-day itinerary JSON.
Convert the given text into a valid JSON that matches the structure shown belowâ€”no markdown, no commentary, only valid JSON.
Each day's plan should have a clear 'caption', 'description', and a 'schedule' of activities.

Use the input text to populate fields intelligently:
- Infer missing but obvious details from context.
- Use arrays for multi-line descriptions.
- Keep empty strings or arrays for missing data.
- All times should be approximate (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) if not explicitly mentioned.
- For duration, estimate if not mentioned (e.g., walking tour ~3.5 hrs).
- Keep JSON strictly valid and complete.

Input text: {extracted_text}

Output JSON structure:
{{
  "plan": [
    {{
      "day": "1",
      "caption": "Short engaging title summarizing the day's experience.",
      "description": [
        "Sentence 1 describing the day.",
        "Sentence 2 describing highlights."
      ],
      "schedule": [
        {{
          "time": "",
          "timeline": "",
          "description": [
            "Sentence 1 describing morning activity.",
            "Sentence 2 elaborating details."
          ],
          "type": {{
            "name": "activity",
            "value": {{
              "name": "Activity name (e.g., Heritage Walk)",
              "duration in hours": 3.5
            }},
            "placename": "Location or area name"
          }},
          "caption": "Short catchy summary for this activity"
        }}
        Add more schedule items as needed
      ]
    }}
    Add more days as needed
  ]
}}

Ensure your final output is valid JSON and matches the schema exactly.
